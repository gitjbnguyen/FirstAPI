# FirstAPI

This is just a small ASP.NET application I made where I compared my experiences of making REST APIs with Java Spring Boot versus using C#'s ASP.NET. I found that this was much more faster and doesn't require Postman as I can use the http file provided in the project to send the request. I also did not have to resort to much dependencies compared to Spring Boot.
